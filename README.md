Hey guys!!

My name is Victor and I am a future front-end programmer, at the moment I am studying Computer Science at Universidade Estadual Paulista "Julio de Mesquita Filho" (UNESP), specializing in C and JavaScript, etc, working to increase my knowledge and experience .
I live a little in Brazil and a little in Canada.
